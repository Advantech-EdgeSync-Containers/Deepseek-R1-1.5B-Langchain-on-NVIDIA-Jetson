Wise-bench logs are saved in `wise-bench.log` file under `/workspace`

### Check Installation Status
Exit from the container and run the following command to check the status of the containers:
```
sudo docker ps
```
Allow some time for containers to become healthy.

### UI Access
Access OpenWebUI via any browser using the URL given below. Create an account and perform a login:
```
http://localhost_or_Jetson_IP:3000
```
### Select Model
In case Ollama has multiple models available, choose from the list of models on the top-left of OpenWebUI after signing up/logging in successfully. As shown below. Select DeepSeek R1 1.5B:

## Prompt Guidelines

This [README](./efficient-prompting-for-compact-models.md) provides essential prompt guidelines to help you get accurate and reliable outputs from small and quantized language models.

## Ollama Logs and Troubleshooting

### Log Files

Once services have been started inside the container, the following log files are generated:

| Log File | Description |
|-----------|---------|
| ollama.pid | Provides process-id for the currently running Ollama service   |
| ollama.log | Provides Ollama service logs |
| uvicorn.log | Provides FastAPI-Langchain service logs |
| uvicorn.pid | Provides FastAPI-Langchain service pid |

### Troubleshoot

Here are quick commands/instructions to troubleshoot issues with the Jetson™ Deepseek Langchain Container:

- View service logs within the container
  ```
  tail -f ollama.log # or
  tail -f uvicorn.log
  ```

- Check if the model is loaded using CPU or GPU or partially both (ideally, it should be 100% GPU loaded).
  ```
  ollama ps
  ```

- Kill & restart services within the container (check pid manually via `ps -eaf` or use pid stored in `ollama.pid` or `uvicorn.pid`)
  ```
  kill $(cat ollama.pid)
  kill $(cat uvicorn.pid)
  ./start_services.sh
  ```

  Confirm there is no Ollama & FastAPI service running using:
  ```
  ps -eaf
  ```

- Enable debug mode for the Ollama service (kill the existing Ollama service first).
  ```
  export OLLAMA_DEBUG=true
  ./start_services.sh
  ```

- In some cases, it has been found that if Ollama is also present at the host, it may give permission issues during pulling models within the container. Uninstalling host Ollama may solve the issue quickly. Follow this link for uninstallation steps - [Uninstall Ollama.](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md#uninstall)


## Best Practices and Recommendations

### Memory Management & Speed
- Ensure models are fully loaded into GPU memory for best results.
- Batch inference for better throughput
- Use stream processing for continuous data
- Offload unwanted models from GPU (use the Keep-Alive parameter for customizing this behavior).
- Enable Jetson™ Clocks for better inference speed
- Used quantized models to balance speed and accuracy
- Increase swap size if models loaded are large
- Use lesser context & batch size to avoid high memory utilization
- Set max-tokens in API payloads to avoid unnecessarily long response generations, which may affect memory utilization.

### Ollama Model Behavior Corrections 
- Restart Ollama services
- Remove the model once and pull it again
- Check if the model is correctly loaded into the GPU or not; it should show loaded as 100% GPU. 
- Create a new Modelfile and set parameters like temperature, repeat penalty, system, etc., as needed to get expected results.

### LangChain Middleware Tuning
- Use asynchronous chains and streaming response handlers to reduce latency in FastAPI endpoints.
- For RAG pipelines, use efficient vector stores (e.g., FAISS with cosine or inner product) and pre-filter data when possible; prefer models with ~3B parameters for better context reliability.
- Avoid long chain dependencies; break workflows into smaller composable components.
- Cache prompt templates and tool results when applicable to reduce unnecessary recomputation
- For agent-based flows, limit tool calls per loop to avoid runaway execution or high memory usage.
- Log intermediate steps (using LangChain’s callbacks) for better debugging and observability
- Use models with ≥3B parameters (e.g., Llama 3.2 3B or larger) for agent development to ensure better reasoning depth and tool usage reliability.

## REST API Access

[**Official Documentation**](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md)

### Ollama APIs
Ollama APIs are accessible on the default endpoint (unless modified). If needed, APIs could be called using code or curl as below:

## Known Limitations

1. Execution Time: The model, when inferred for the first time via OpenWebUI, takes longer time (within 10 seconds) as the model gets loaded into the GPU. 
2. RAM Utilization: RAM utilization for running this container image occupies approximately >5 GB RAM when running on NVIDIA® Orin™ NX – 8 GB. Running this image on Jetson™ Nano may require some additional steps, like increasing swap size or using lower quantization as suited. 
3. OpenWebUI Dependencies: When OpenWebUI is started for the first time, it installs a few dependencies that are then persisted in the associated Docker volume. Allow it some time to set up these dependencies. This is a one-time activity.


## Possible Use Cases

Leverage the container image to build interesting use cases like:

- Predictive Maintenance Chatbots: Integrate with edge telemetry or logs to summarize anomalies, explain error codes, or recommend corrective actions using historical context.

- Compliance and Audit Q&A: Run offline LLMs trained on local policy or compliance data to assist with audits or generate summaries of regulatory alignment—ensuring data never leaves the premises.

- Safety Manual Conversational Agents: Deploy LLMs to provide instant answers from on-site safety manuals or procedures, reducing downtime and improving adherence to protocols.

- Technician Support Bots: Field service engineers can interact with the bot to troubleshoot equipment based on past repair logs, parts catalogs, and service manuals.

- Smart Edge Controllers: LLMs can translate human intent (e.g., “reduce line 2 speed by 10%”) into control commands for industrial PLCs or middleware using AI agents.

- Conversational Retrieval (RAG): Integrate with vector databases (like FAISS and ChromaDB) to retrieve relevant context from local documents and enable conversational Q&A over your custom data.

- Tool-Enabled Agents: Create intelligent agents that use calculators, APIs, or search tools as part of their reasoning process—LangChain handles the logic and LLM interface.

- Factory Incident Reporting: Ingest logs or voice input → extract incident type → summarize → trigger automated alerts or next steps
